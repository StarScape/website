        <div class="question">
          <h4>"Who are you?"</h4>
          <p>I'm just some guy, y'know?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h4>"But like, really..."</h4>
          <p>Okay, fine. I'm a software engineer from North Carolina and my name is Arrington, Jack Arrington (cue Bond music).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h4>"Is that it? You're not going to try to sell me something? I came all this way, do you know how rare it is to actually visit someone's personal landing page it is in 2023?"</h4>
          <p>You typed 'it is' twice, and, oh right! I make a pretty box to type words into called <a href="https://www.dropletwriter.com/">Droplet</a>, which you should totally download.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h4>"You're not going to say some words about your secret sauce, what makes you unique?"</h4>
          <p>Oh sweet summer childâ€”in a world of billions, nary a one is unique.</p>
          <p>But since you insist, shill I will: I suppose what makes me different is that I consider myself more of a creative than a technical person. I have a technical mind, I can recite various obscurities about type systems and text editor internals and concurrency models and want to know the machine down to the hardware, etc, but my motivations are creative. I want to make stuff. That's all I've ever wanted to do.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h4>"Do you have a specific skill set or something?"</h4>
          <p>I do web and mobile development, mostly. </p>
          <p>I haven't felt technically challenged by that in some time, so an eventual change is on the table. Still the best way to do stuff that is at least creative-adjacent, though.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h4>"What's your software engineering hot take?"</h4>
          <p>Static and dynamic typing both have their pros and cons and people's justifications for why one is inherently better than the other are typically just a thin veil over personal preference.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h4>"What is your favorite place you've travelled to / [some other question that will allow you to humblebrag about how worldly you are]?"</h4>
          <p>Northern Thailand, specifically the stretches <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Pai,+Pai+District,+Mae+Hong+Son,+Thailand/Ban+Rak+Thai,+%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B9%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%9A%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%81%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AE%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%99+Tambon+Mok+Cham+Pae,+%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B7%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87+Mae+Hong+Son+58000,+Thailand/@19.4775397,98.0434732,10.61z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x30da81b0e91eaceb:0x40079e40c8939ddf!2m2!1d98.4404863!2d19.3582191!1m5!1m1!1s0x30d0042cf8f1b971:0xfe9f1eacc4d30d6f!2m2!1d97.9425786!2d19.5869727!3e0?entry=ttu">between Pai and Ban Rak Thai</a>, as seen from the top of a motorbike.</p>

        <div class="question">
          <h4>"What's something most people don't know about you?"</h4>
          <p>I wrote a full-length novel as a teenager.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h4>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production#Dry_process">Natural</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production#Wet_process">Washed</a>?"</h4>
          <p>Natural, whatever Scott Rao says.</p>

        <div class="question">
          <h4>"What is the <s>correct</s> best spelling of the color between black and white?"</h4>
          <p>Grey, and I'm even American.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h4>"Why is there a sunset on your website?"</h4>
          <p>Because a sunset not only connects us, through its timelessness, to our past, but the beauty of a phenomenon so eye-catching made possible only by atmospheric pollution reminds us of the inherit contradictions of inhabiting the Anthropocene, and our uncertain future.</p>
          <p>/s okay, because it's pretty. A younger, more naive me spent way too much time designing a cool portfolio website during senior year of college thinking it would get me hired. News flash: nobody cares, so I got rid of all the "iamveryqualifiedgivejobpls" parts and kept the sunset.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h4>"How can I get in contact with you?"</h4>
          <p>Shoot me a message at mail at jackarrington dot com.</p>
          <p>Does spelling it like that do anything these days? I imagine LLMs or even just a clever regex could figure it out and spam me anyway. Oh well.</p>
